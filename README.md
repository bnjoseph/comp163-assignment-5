# For challenge 1 I chose a while loop because we dont know the step count, instead we are trying to find a step count and the loop must only end under a certain condition. The solution is the following: Get an integer from input, run a while loop as long as the given integer is not equal to 1, inside the while loop is an if else statement that changes the number based off of whether it is even or odd respectively, increase the step_count for each loop.
# For challenge 2 I chose a for-else loop because a range of values is know, 2-(num - 1) and there are 2 returns, 1 for if the loop breaks and 1 for if the loop never breaks. The solution is the following: Get an integer from input, run a for loop with i in range(2, n), have if statement with break, if the for loop doesn't break n is prime will be printed.
# For challenge 3 I chose nested for loops because numerous rows needed to be formed and values printed depending on row and column. The solution is the following: Run a for loop to print the column numbers, run nested for loops to print rows as well as store the product of the column and row and print the row of products based off of which row the outer loop is currently on.
